# TgCharts

With this project we want to avail a library which can generate charts using angular only, taking advantage of angular's wonder full data binding availabilities.

## Getting started
If you are using angular cli for your angular application, then you can use

```shell
ng add tg-charts
```
to add `tg-charts` to your project.

If you want to do it manually, using your package manager.
```shell
npm install tg-charts
```
and include `node_modules/tg-charts/pie/style/pie-default-colour.css` in your application styles.
